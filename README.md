<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>The program uses a <em>UTF-8 character encoding</em>. I recommend not to use this along with editors who do not know 
how to properly store the UTF-8 format.
</p>
<p>This program is made to a web editor and can accept root directory of the home directory path  the following names: 
VAR, HOME, USR, WEB, WWW, APACHE, HOMEPAGE, PUBLIC_HTML. These are the most recent self-created directory names in their own
  windows platform (does not automatically <em>public_html</em> never home directory path first).</p>
  
  <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Do not edit a file that another program to use at the same time. Do not keep the file open in another window
  in the textareassa at the same time in another window when you try to edit it, as this file may be recorded incorrectly.</p>

<p>However, if you have the files in the ISO-8859-15 or a similar Character Encoding, you can change them at edirorilla when you click on 
the edit page, the checkbox for "Show text in UTF-8 Character Encoding".</p>
   <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Do not click on this option, if the file is already UF8 format (you'll find it on that special characters and umlauts is already 
   correctly). Using this function, you can also repair the files that are scheduled to appear in UTF-8 encoding, but the editor is the "force" 
   saved in the wrong format. However, if a file is lost in a lot of garbage characters, so that it is therefore no longer a pure ISO
   Character Encoding, this still does not fix everything.</p>
